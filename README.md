Overview
This project demonstrates the application of RLE and Huffman Coding algorithms for data optimization in a healthcare management system. It includes a PHP-based implementation to simulate the compression and decompression of healthcare data, which can be used to manage medical records more efficiently.

Features
-RLE Compression: Efficiently compresses redundant data, particularly useful for medical imaging.
-Huffman Coding: Compresses textual data by using variable-length codes based on character frequencies.
-Data Decompression: Supports the retrieval of original data from compressed files.
-PHP-Based Implementation: Uses PHP scripts to demonstrate the integration of these algorithms in a healthcare management system.


Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

-Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/abigail-ibrahim/HealthCare-Data-Optimization-Management-System/tree/main

-Navigate to the Project Directory
cd <project-directory>

-Start the PHP Local Server

Ensure that PHP is installed on your machine. You can start the PHP local server by running:


php -S localhost:8000
-Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to:


http://localhost:8000
-Requirements
-PHP 7.4 or later
-Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

Usage

-Use the interface to upload healthcare data files.
-Select the desired compression algorithm (RLE or Huffman).
-View the compressed data and compare sizes before and after optimization.
-Decompress data to verify the accuracy of the algorithms.
